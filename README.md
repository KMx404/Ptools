# :floppy_disk: ptools 

What's this ?
<br />
These  tools idea came to me by an accident and it's just for me to get used to the pascal language since it was the basic language for my CS class 
I'm willing to code  more tools with pascal to see it's capabilities and since it's an easy language to learn may be i'll do some frameworks or maybe re:update
<br />
## :gift: How can i help ? 
since the code is on github so it's an open source . You can look out for the code maybe some bugs i did not notice or pay attention for . 
You can pull some requests and i'll review them and fix the code. You can add your own scripts via A pull request as well  
<br />
## :bookmark: What's the point ?
The hall point of making this tool is just to enjoy coding cause it's really not based on any language what so ever . And counting that i'm using this one a lot
maybe doing some projects/tools won't be that bad after all 
### :computer: Technical details : 
	- I need more resources for the newbies 
	- Anyone can recognize a good place to check few pascal tutorials or documentations . Contact Me 
	- API'S can be really helpful so it can start with multiple languages maybe

# :bell: The tools : 
In this repository you'll find a lot of pascal tools each one have a specific role.
Since it would take a lot of time to read the code and understand it's role
here you can find the role of each script : 

- ToKnow.pas : A pascal script can help you with few technical stuff (Under development)
- ArrayUtil : A set of tools to manipulate arrays (Fixed)
- QuotesGenerator : A pascal code that generates random quotes (Under development)  
<br /> 
<br />

## :dart: TO-DO'S: 
- Complete the ToKnow tool
- Check for better resources,  documentations 
- Start the dictionary tool 
- Importing files, links in pascal (Do the QuotesGenerator)
